Lecture Notes from a class I gave in 3D Graphics with OpenGL

I am in the process of converting the slides from Powerpoint to Beamer manually. 

These slides are from the early-to-mid 2000s and still describes OpenGL 1.4.
OpenGL has since evolved and these slides are quite out of date and are not inline with the
latest version of OpenGL.
