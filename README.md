# opengl-lectures
Lecture Notes from a class I gave in 3D Graphics with OpenGL in 2006, 2007 and
2008. 

The slides have been converted from Powerpoint to LaTeX Beamer. 

These slides are from the early-to-mid 2000s and still describes OpenGL 1.4.
OpenGL has since evolved and these slides are quite out of date and are not inline with the latest version of OpenGL.
